I represent a Metacello Project and act as a Cargo project.
Dependencies of this project will be loaded by Metacello as a black box for Cargo.
I specify one or many packages / groups to load. Package dependencies are not described and so, a package/group can be seen as a package unit with no dependencies.

	See my subclasses for examples
